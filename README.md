### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Shrey Jain, a Machine Learning Engineer who is interested in creating deep learning models, deployment architecture, microservices, containers, and cloud-native technology. I encourage the use of automation wherever possible and I think that everything can be automated. I want to share everything I've learned throughout my data Journey, which is why I have started contributing actively to Medium blogs to disseminate valuable information to the broader community.
